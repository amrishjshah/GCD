Read the source directory files of training and test datasets into data tables

trainingDataset     | merged file with all training datasets
testDataset         | merged file with all test datasets
trainingTestDataset | final merged dataset including training and test files


columnNames         | holdes the column names for each column in trainingTestDataset table
columnArray         | holds true value for ID, mean, and standard dev

trainingTestDatasetwithoutActivityType  | holds final data without activity type
tidyAverageData     | holds average data for each activity and each subject

Brief Algorithm
1. Create data tables by reading the source files. Assign appropriate column names. Merge the training and test data files into single dataset.
2. Seperate out the columns for mean and stddev. Create a list of ID, mean, and standard deviation.
3. Merge the final data set with activity name data table to get meaningful names.
4. Using gsub () for pattern replacement to cleanup column names.
5. Create a tidy dataset with average of each variable for each activity for each subject.
